# Alacritty configuration

### How to install

- Using homebrew

  ```zsh
  brew install --cask --no-quarantine alacritty
  ```

- Using others

  **Please change your computer**. :zipper_mouth_face: ( I'm sorry but I don't know how to install without homebrew )

### How to configure it

After you clone the [working-env](https://github.com/kafelix496/working-env/tree/master/nvim), you need to make a symbolic link.

```zsh
ln -s ~/working-env/alacritty ~/.config/
```

:pushpin: If you happen to clone the [working-env](https://github.com/kafelix496/working-env/tree/master/nvim) repository not in home directory,
you have to change `~/working-env` to `path-you-cloned`
